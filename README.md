# MH-Kit Ruby CLI Application

# Background Description / Motivation
*The reason programming caught my eye to begin with was because of its capabilities to create a positive impact in this world and help people. 

*While this app won't really help anyone in the real world,  itâ€™s a step towards that burning desire and a spark for the ideas engine.

*With 'RUOK' day around the corner i have themed my application around mental illness.
